# PeachMix (v2)

PeachMix is a single-page application that I originally made during my freshman year in college back in 2020, which I now revamped using React technology as of 2023. Users are allowed to make music on a platform only using their keyboard/finger touches through three types of modes: Preset (preloaded sounds), Piano (mimics a piano), or Import (uses and modifies sound files that users can custom import). Using React, I was able to optimize audio files, allow for faster and more efficient renders, add a Piano playback feature, and add little easter eggs whenever you click a small Peach icon.
