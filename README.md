# 🎵 PeachMix

**PeachMix** is an interactive web-based music platform that allows users to create sounds using their keyboard or touchscreen. Built with React, the app offers three dynamic modes of music-making:  
- **Preset Mode** – Play with preloaded sound samples  
- **Piano Mode** – Simulates piano keys for playing melodies  
- **Import Mode** – Upload and modify your own audio files

Originally built in 2020 and fully reimagined in 2023, PeachMix now features optimized audio rendering, a curated collection of playable pop songs, and hidden easter eggs—just look out for the little 🍑 icon.
